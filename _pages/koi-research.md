IKI cooperates with a number of institutions that are on the forefront of Koi-related research. The fields range from virology, bacteria, business to Koi food. Partner Koi farms actively run experiments, improve their practices and provide feedback.

### Ongoing research

One mission of IKI is to field-test and apply new research at different levels of the supply chain, including breeders, retailers and koi keepers. This takes place during field studies, experiments at breeders and in product development. The findings of our partners have been especially helpful in bringing traditional Koi breeding into the modern age.

### Cooperation with NPUST

NPUST is on the forefront of Koi research. IKIâ€™s cooperating with NPUST allows us to provide industry feedback, train interns and plan an active part in the research process. Some courses offered are taking place at NPUST.
