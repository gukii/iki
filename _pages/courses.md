### Online and offline courses

Courses can be taken at IKI, in Taiwan, at partner institutions in China and some online. Our model follows a “freemium” approach where most courses are offered free of charge and only premium courses require tuition. Students that take the free courses and sign up for a certification-track pay a low examination fee and – upon passing the exams – get certified in their mastery of the course subject by IKI, they receive a **certificate**.

Some premium courses are offered at IKI in Taiwan and at select locations in mainland China. These courses are targeted at industry professionals and premium Koi keepers. Here the course model incorporates the student’s Koi keeping environment and situation.

Courses thought in China often coincide with Koi shows and take place before, during or after the show. Please contact us for more details.

### Certified mastery

Upon successful completion of a course and passing exams, our students are awarded a certificate indicating their mastery of the course subject. Students part of a signature course are able to proof their skills, mastery of subject and ability to their peers, customers and employers within the Koi industry.
