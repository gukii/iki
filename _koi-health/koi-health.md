Only Koi that pass our stringent health checks get certified and issued health certificates.

### CERTIFIED DEALERS

IKI also certifies Koi dealers and retailers further down the supply chain. Their facilities and shipping process have to pass inspection and are subject to random checks. Certified retailers, dealers and whole-sellers improve their standard by taking seminars with IKI and pass annual tests.

Health check involving blood tests and virology, ultra sound to determine the gender and state of eggs, use of X-ray to ensure Koi bones and bubble are without problem. The Koi get chipped and receive a IKI certificate in addition to the certificate of origin by the Koifarm (e.g. Sakai or Sing Chang).

### HEALTH CHECKS FOR OTHER KOI

Any Koi can go through the same health check process like the above mentioned parent Koi. The process involves time and incurs costs, but provides peace of mind and helps to ensure a problem-free import ok Koi.

Customers seeking to reduce risk of introducing new Koi to their farms, shops and ponds often choose our certified shipping and health check service.
